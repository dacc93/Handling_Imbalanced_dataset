# Handling_Imbalanced_dataset
This repository is IPython Notebook for Kaggle Dataset,

- The aim of this project is detecting fraudulent or non-fraudulent transactions while dealing with imbalanced data. To achieve this, various supervised learning algorithms will be used and the results will be compared.

- Imbalanced data refers to classification problems based on the binary class inequality. There are several methods for dealing with this problem like Re-Sampling, Generate Synthetic Samples, Anomaly Detection Methods or performance metrics instead of accuracy results.

- In this project, the undersampling method will be implemented to the majority class and performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score and AUC and some anomaly detection methods like one-class SVM and Neural Network will be used to find the best algorithm which highly predicted fraudulent or non-fraudulent transactions.
